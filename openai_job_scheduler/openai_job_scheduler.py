Problem:
Design and implement a job scheduler that supports:

Delayed execution: jobs can be scheduled to run N seconds in the future.

Recurring execution: jobs can be scheduled to repeat every N seconds.

Cancellation: jobs can be cancelled before they run.

Concurrency-safe: supports multiple workers processing jobs in memory safely.

Constraints:

Jobs are in-memory only (no persistence needed).

Each job is a function (e.g., () => void) passed to the scheduler.

You should provide an API to schedule, cancel, and list jobs.

Recurring jobs should continue running until explicitly cancelled.

Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
scheduler.schedule(job_id="foo", fn=print_hello, delay=10)         # Runs once in 10s  
scheduler.schedule(job_id="bar", fn=check_status, interval=5)      # Runs every 5s  
scheduler.cancel(job_id="bar")                                     # Stops recurring job  
Implement this in a single-threaded or multi-threaded modelâ€”your choice.
